### Intro to Grammar
- What?
    - define/characterize a language (a set of strings, sequences of chars mechanism/tool/device/machinery/mathematical abstraction for telling whether a string is in a certain set)
    e.g. the value 4-2-1 is 1 not 3
- Why?
    - the structure contributes to the meaning
        the compiler generates executable code
        if a wtring is not in the language the compiler cannot do anything
        "int x = 2+;"
- How?
    - finite languages don't really need a grammar
    - expect some kind of recursion or induction
- A grammar consists of 4 pieces of information (quadruple)
1. A set whose symbols are called terminals
2. A set whose symbols are called non-terminals
3. A distinguished non-terminal start or root
4. A set of productions
    - a production is 
        - a := b
    - where a and b are strings of terminals and non-terminals
### Syntax vs. Semantics
- *Syntax* refers to the structure of the sentences of the language
- *Semantics* refers to the meaning of the sentences of the language
- When talking about PL, a sentence refers to a program
    - Example 1. - Sentences with the **same** syntax might have **different** meaning
    - Consider the syntactic rule defining a date:
            - dd / dd / dddd
        - where d stands for a digit. The date
            - 01 / 12 / 2018
        is syntactically correct. however, it comes with two interpretations: it could either mean December 1, 2018 or January 12, 2018. In other words, the same string can be read as:
            - day/month/year or month/day/year
        - Consider the expression 2 + 3 * 9. It could either mean 45 or 29
