CS 425, Fall 2023, week 7 Assignment.

Problem 1

Extend the minimal interpreter coded in Scheme during the lecture.
The extension must include some new binary operation, like the average
of two integers.  Choose a user-defined function, not a library
function.  Experiment with a lookup architecture to map the
representation of operators in an expression to be interpreted to the
corresponding procedure.

The total amount of code is a handful of lines.

Problem 2

Compare the representation of binary trees in SML and Scheme.
Consider binary trees where the information is only in the branches
and binary trees where the information is only in the leaves.

The total amount of code is about 10 lines per tree kind per language
including a function that traverses a tree for testing purposes.
