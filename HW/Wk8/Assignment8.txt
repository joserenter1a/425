The goal is to construct a list of student identifiers.
A student indentifier is either a 9-digit number starting with 95,
e.g., 951234567 or a pair of strings, the first and last names
of a students, e.g., ("Joe","Programmer").

Code two programs, one in Standard ML and the other in Scheme.
Each programs should encode a couple of examples of lists as described
above and a function.  The function takes a string s and a list l
and returns a list containing all the pairs of l in which s is
the first name. 

Include a couple of tests of the function.

Say whether you coded first in Scheme or first in ML.
